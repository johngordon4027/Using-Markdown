# Learning how to use markdown

Learning how to use markdown has been fairly simple. I do still need to go back and forth from the tutorial every so often so I know which symbols to use for each input. It is a little confusing having to remember the ** for bold and _ for italics etc. I know after a while I will get used to using it. I am looking forward to seeing what we start using the github website for whether that be to code or for something else.
